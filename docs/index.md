On this page# What is Backstage?




Backstage is an open source framework for building developer
portals. Powered by a centralized software catalog, Backstage restores order to
your microservices and infrastructure and enables your product teams to ship
high-quality code quickly — without compromising autonomy.


Backstage unifies all your infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation
to create a streamlined development environment from end to end.



Out of the box, Backstage includes:


- 
Backstage Software Catalog for
managing all your software (microservices, libraries, data pipelines,
websites, ML models, etc.)



- 
Backstage Software Templates for
quickly spinning up new projects and standardizing your tooling with your
organization’s best practices



- 
Backstage TechDocs for making it easy to
create, maintain, find, and use technical documentation, using a "docs like
code" approach



- 
Plus, a growing ecosystem of
open source plugins
that further expand Backstage’s customizability and functionality





## Backstage and the CNCF​


Backstage is a CNCF Incubation project after graduating from Sandbox. Read the announcement
here.

## Benefits​


- 
For engineering managers, it allows you to maintain standards and best
practices across the organization, and can help you manage your whole tech
ecosystem, from migrations to test certification.



- 
For end users (developers), it makes it fast and simple to build software
components in a standardized way, and it provides a central place to manage
all projects and documentation.



- 
For platform engineers, it enables extensibility and scalability by letting
you easily integrate new tools and services (via plugins), as well as
extending the functionality of existing ones.



- 
For everyone, it’s a single, consistent experience that ties all your
infrastructure tooling, resources, standards, owners, contributors, and
administrators together in one place.
